# GitHub Actions Workflows

This repository contains a collection of GitHub Actions workflow files for automating CI/CD processes in various project scenarios. Each workflow file is tailored to a specific use case and is designed to streamline development and deployment tasks.

## Workflows

### 1. End to End CI/CD Workflow for Java Application with Maven, Sonar, and Kubernetes Integration

- **File Name**: `deploy-java-with-maven-sonar-k8s.yml`
- **Description**: This workflow automates the end-to-end CI/CD process for a Java application. It includes building the application with Maven, performing code analysis with SonarQube, and deploying the application to Kubernetes.

### 2. Deploy to Kubernetes

- **File Name**: `deploy-to-k8s.yml`
- **Description**: This workflow deploys an application to Kubernetes. It builds a Docker image, pushes it to a container registry, and then deploys the application using `kubectl` with the provided Kubernetes manifests.

### 3. Deploy to Swarm (Docker Swarm)

- **File Name**: `deploy-to-swarm.yml`
- **Description**: This workflow deploys an application to Docker Swarm. It builds a Docker image, pushes it to a container registry, and then deploys the application to the Docker Swarm cluster using `docker stack deploy` with the provided stack configuration file.

## Workflow Usage Guide

1. **Navigate to the folder containing the desired workflow file.**

   This repository contains multiple workflow files, each tailored to a specific CI/CD scenario. Navigate to the folder that corresponds to the workflow you intend to use.

2. **Read the specific instructions and configurations within each workflow file to understand its purpose and requirements.**

   Take the time to carefully review the contents of the workflow file you've selected. Pay attention to any comments or documentation provided within the file, as it will help you understand how the workflow is structured and what tasks it performs.

3. **Customize the workflow files as needed for your own projects.**

   Once you understand how the workflow operates, you may need to customize certain aspects to fit your project's requirements. This could include modifying environment variables, adjusting build steps, or updating deployment configurations.

4. **Add the workflow files to your GitHub repository and customize them according to your project requirements.**

   After customizing the workflow file, add it to your GitHub repository. Ensure that it is placed in the appropriate location and named correctly according to GitHub Actions conventions. If necessary, make any additional adjustments to align the workflow with your project's structure and dependencies.

5. **Commit and push the changes to trigger the workflows in your GitHub repository.**

   Once you've added and customized the workflow file, commit your changes and push them to your GitHub repository. GitHub Actions will automatically detect the new workflow file and begin executing it according to the specified triggers and conditions.
